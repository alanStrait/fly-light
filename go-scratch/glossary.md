## Important Concepts for fly.io
- [x] Tour of Go, focus areas
  - [ ] goroutines
  - [ ] channels
  - [ ] context
  - [ ] interfaces
  - [ ] standard library
  - [ ] Project:
    - [ ] Simple CLI 
      - [ ] Fetch data from SpaceX, output formatted JSON or text.
      - [ ] Focus: structs, HTTP, and flags.
    - [ ] Fly.io Context
      - [ ] `machined`, skim documentation for, the Go-based agent that runs on Fly machines.
        - [ ] Get a feel for the code.
- [ ] Rust
  - [ ] "Rust Book", through Chapter 9.
    - [ ] Core concepts: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, error handling.
  - [ ] Setup `rust-analyzer` in VS Code.
  - [ ] Fly.io Context, from github repositories:
    - [ ] `fly-proxy`, Rust proxy that handles your app's traffic.
    - [ ] `loco`, runtime coordinator.
    - [ ] `Cargo.toml` to see what crates are used.

## Glossary
- Array
  - Does not require make
  - Is fixed sized, `arr := [5]int{}`]
- Buffered channel
  - A channel with a limit or capacity, reporte by cap(ch)
- Channel
  - `<-`
  - The direction that data flows for a go routine?
- Context
- Goroutine
- Interface
- make 
  - Required by `channels`, `slices`, and `maps`.
  - References types that require initialization.
- map
  - key-value dictionaries
  - Can be given capacity when `make(map[string]int, 10)` has capacity 10
- select
  - `select` statements lets a `goroutine` wait on multiple communication operations.
  - Blocks until one of its cases can run, 
    - then it executes that case. 
    - Chooses at random if more than one ready to run.
    - Runs `default` case in a select is run if no other case is ready.
- slices
  - Dynamically-sized arrays that can be mutated
  - Can be given capacity on `make(s, 10)`, has capacity 10
- Standard Library
- Struct
  - `type Point struct { X, Y int }`
  - `p := Point{1, 2}`
