# Go Glossary

- Array
  - Does not require make
  - Is fixed sized, `arr := [5]int{}`]
- buffered channel
  - A channel with a limit or capacity, reporte by cap(ch)
- channel
  - `<-`
  - The direction that data flows for a go routine?
- make 
  - Required by `channels`, `slices`, and `maps`.
  - References types that require initialization.
- map
  - key-value dictionaries
  - Can be given capacity when `make(map[string]int, 10)` has capacity 10
- select
  - `select` statements lets a `goroutine` wait on multiple communication operations.
  - Blocks until one of its cases can run, 
    - then it executes that case. 
    - Chooses at random if more than one ready to run.
    - Runs `default` case in a select is run if no other case is ready.
- slices
  - Dynamically-sized arrays that can be mutated
  - Can be given capacity on `make(s, 10)`, has capacity 10
- Struct
  - `type Point struct { X, Y int }`
  - `p := Point{1, 2}`
