# FlyKv

FlyKv provides RESTful access to a key-value store that tracks machine information by region.

## Starting the server

PubSub is used for distributed communication requring `name` and `cookie` to be set on start.

`iex --name fly-kv@127.0.0.1 --cookie mysharedcookie -S mix phx.server` 

As a pure API project, these options minimized the code that has been generated.

To see available endpoints, please use `mix phx.routes`.

## Mix Command to Create
The following `mix` command was used to generate this project, fly_kv.

```
mix phx.new fly_kv --no-assets --no-ecto --no-gettext --no-html --no-mailer
```

As a result, the artifacts generated by mix are minimal, focusing on FlyKv as an API.
