# ExScratch

A plae to create solutions to exercises for the purpose of learning and 
practicing Elixir.  

## Exercises
Elixir exercises are found in the `lib/exercises` directory and come from
two sources: `A Tour of Go`, and `Exercism.com`.  These exercises are intended
to be run from `iex` and will be listed here as they are created.
