# Proxy Responsibilities in a Distributed Architecture

## Arya's Summary

An excellent architectural question. The short answer is that while the core function of a proxy is routing and access management, there is absolutely a category of business logic that not only belongs in a proxy like `fly-proxy` but is essential to its role as a secure, performant, and resilient gateway.

A well-designed `fly-proxy` should be the **enforcement and operational boundary** for your system. Its primary duty is managing access to internal APIs, but it's also the single most logical and efficient place to implement logic that must be applied consistently to *all* incoming traffic before it hits your business services.

Here is a breakdown of the logic that belongs—and doesn't belong—in your Rust `fly-proxy`.

### Logic That Should Be in the Proxy (The "How")

This is logic concerned with the mechanics of *how* a request is handled, not *what* the request ultimately does.

1.  **Authentication & Authorization:** The proxy is the perfect gatekeeper. It should validate JWTs, API keys, or session cookies. It should enforce coarse-grained access control (e.g., "Does this user have a valid token?" or "Is this service allowed to talk to that service?"). The internal API should then handle fine-grained authorization ("Is this user allowed to delete *this specific* resource?").

2.  **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Protecting your internal services from abuse, whether malicious (DDoS) or accidental (a buggy client), is a proxy's job. Implementing token bucket or sliding window algorithms here prevents downstream services from being overwhelmed.

3.  **SSL/TLS Termination:** The proxy should handle the incoming HTTPS connections, decrypt the traffic, and then communicate with internal services over a trusted network (often with plain HTTP or mutual TLS for service-to-service communication). This centralizes cryptographic complexity.

4.  **Load Balancing:** Intelligently distributing requests among healthy instances of a backend service is a classic proxy function. This includes health checks and removing failing nodes from the pool.

5.  **Request/Response Transformation:**
    *   **Header Manipulation:** Injecting standardized headers (e.g., `X-Request-ID` for tracing), stripping unwanted headers from clients, or adding headers for the internal service context (e.g., `X-User-ID` after authentication).
    *   **Protocol Translation:** A more advanced use case, but a proxy could translate between gRPC-Web (client) and gRPC (backend) or REST and GraphQL.

6.  **Caching:** For *public*, immutable, or rarely changing data (e.g., API documentation, static assets, public user profiles), the proxy can serve responses directly from its cache, drastically reducing load on the backend.

7.  **Basic Observability:** The proxy is the ideal place to gather metrics (request rates, latency, error rates) and emit structured logs and traces for every request entering your system. This provides a unified view of traffic.

8.  **Failover and Circuit Breaking:** If a backend service starts failing or timing out, the proxy can short-circuit requests to it, returning a default error or serving stale cache, preventing a cascade failure.

### Logic That Should **NOT** Be in the Proxy (The "What")

This is logic that defines your application's unique value proposition and core functionality.

1.  **Core Business Rules:** Any logic that involves calculating prices, applying discounts, processing an order, updating a user's profile, or running a machine learning model belongs in the dedicated backend services.
2.  **Complex Data Validation:** While the proxy should validate basics (e.g., "is the JWT valid?"), deep validation of request payloads against complex business schemas should be done by the service that owns the data. The proxy's validation is for protection; the service's validation is for correctness.
3.  **Database/Storage Access:** The proxy should never directly connect to your application databases or object storage. Its communication should be with other services.
4.  **Orchestration of Multiple Services:** If a single client request requires coordinating calls to several backend services (the "orchestrator" pattern), that logic should live in a dedicated API gateway service or BFF (Backend for Frontend), not the edge proxy. The proxy should route to that orchestrator.

### Why Rust is an Excellent Choice for This

Your choice of Rust is particularly well-suited for a proxy, reinforcing this design:

*   **Performance & Low Latency:** Rust's zero-cost abstractions ensure that the overhead of all this logic (auth, rate limiting) is minimal, keeping latency low.
*   **Memory Safety:** As the public-facing entry point, your proxy is a high-value target. Rust's compile-time memory safety guarantees make it resistant to whole classes of vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free) that could lead to a severe security breach.
*   **Reliability:** The proxy is critical path. If it crashes, your entire application is down. Rust's focus on eliminating null dereferences and data races results in an incredibly stable and predictable service.
*   **Ecosystem:** Excellent libraries (`hyper` for HTTP, `tokio` for async) provide a fantastic foundation for building robust network services.

### Conclusion

Think of your `fly-proxy` not as a "dumb router" but as a **smart, secure, and operational border control.**

Its business logic is the logic of **enforcement, protection, and observation.** It should know *who* is allowed in and *how fast* they can come in, and it should log everyone who passes through. It should *not*, however, be involved in the business deals those people conduct once they are inside.

This separation of concerns keeps your proxy lean, focused, and scalable, while your backend services remain pure to their business domains. It's a classic and highly effective pattern.
